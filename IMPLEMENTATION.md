## 📝 Additional Notes

### Performance Considerations

1. **Receipt Storage:** Base64 storage increases database size. Consider external storage for production.
2. **Filtering:** Client-side filtering is fine for <1000 expenses. For larger datasets, implement server-side filtering.
3. **Image Optimization:** Add image compression before upload.

### Future Enhancements

1. **Recurring Automation:** Add cron job to auto-create recurring expenses
2. **Receipt OCR:** Extract amount/date from receipt images
3. **Advanced Search:** Full-text search with Postgres
4. **Filter Presets:** Save common filter combinations
5. **Export with Receipts:** Include receipt images in PDF exports

### Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Edge 90+
- ✅ Firefox 88+
- ✅ Safari 14+
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### Known Limitations

1. Receipt files stored as base64 (not optimal for production)
2. No recurring expense automation (manual for now)
3. Filters are client-side (may be slow with 1000+ expenses)
4. No receipt OCR/parsing yet
