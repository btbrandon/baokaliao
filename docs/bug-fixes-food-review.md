## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. ⭐ Rating Display Bug - FIXED ✅

**Problem:** 2.5 star rating showed as 3 stars after adding the dish

**Root Cause:**

- JavaScript falsy check: `newDish.rating || undefined`
- Ratings of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 were treated as falsy
- These were converted to `undefined` instead of preserving the actual value

**Solution:**

```typescript
// Before (buggy)
rating: newDish.rating || undefined;

// After (fixed)
rating: newDish.rating !== null && newDish.rating !== undefined ? newDish.rating : undefined;
```

**Changes Made:**

1. Explicit null/undefined check instead of falsy check
2. Updated state type to allow `rating: number | null`
3. Fixed display condition: `{dish.rating !== undefined && dish.rating !== null && <Rating .../>}`

**Result:** All star ratings (0 to 5) now save and display correctly ⭐⭐⭐

### 2. 📝 Inline Editing - FIXED ✅

**Problem:** Clicking a dish to edit showed the edit form in a separate box below, creating duplication:

```
Dish A (display)
Dish A (edit form)  ← Confusing!
Dish B
```

**Solution:** Edit form now replaces the dish in-place:

```
Dish A (edit form)  ← Clear!
Dish B
```

**Implementation:**

- Use conditional rendering: `editingDishIndex === index ? <EditForm /> : <DishDisplay />`
- Edit form appears exactly where the dish was
- Other dishes stay in their positions
- Only show "Add New Dish" form when NOT editing

**Visual Improvements:**

- Edit form has primary.main border (blue)
- Edit form has action.hover background (highlighted)
- Clear "Edit Dish" title
- Update and Cancel buttons

### 3. 📸 Photo Upload Error - FIXED ✅

**Problem:**

```
Error uploading file: StorageApiError: Bucket not found
status: 400, statusCode: '404'
```

**Root Cause:** Supabase storage bucket `food-review-photos` doesn't exist yet

**Solution:** Create the storage bucket in Supabase Dashboard

**Documentation Created:**

- Complete setup guide at `docs/supabase-storage-setup.md`
- Step-by-step instructions with screenshots
- CLI commands for automation
- Security policy examples
- Troubleshooting tips

**Quick Fix Steps:**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to Storage section
3. Create new bucket: `food-review-photos`
4. Enable "Public bucket" option
5. Save and test upload

## 🔧 Additional Improvements

### Smart Delete Handling

When deleting a dish while editing:

- Automatically cancels edit mode
- Adjusts edit index if needed
- Prevents index mismatch errors

**New Function:**

```typescript
handleRemoveDishWithEditCheck(index);
```

**Behavior:**

- If deleting the dish being edited → cancel edit first
- If deleting a dish before the one being edited → adjust index
- If deleting any other dish → remove normally

- [ ] Add dish with 2.5 stars → displays 2.5 stars
- [ ] Add dish with 5 stars → displays 5 stars
- [ ] Edit dish rating from 3 to 2.5 → saves and shows 2.5

### Inline Editing

- [ ] Click dish A → edit form appears IN PLACE of dish A
- [ ] Dish A is hidden during edit
- [ ] Other dishes (B, C, D) stay in same positions
- [ ] "Add New Dish" form is hidden during edit
- [ ] Update button saves changes in-place
- [ ] Cancel button restores original dish display

### Delete During Edit

## 💡 Key Learnings

### JavaScript Gotchas

- `0 || undefined` returns `undefined` (0 is falsy!)
- Always use explicit checks: `value !== null && value !== undefined`
- Be careful with boolean coercion

### React Patterns

- Conditional rendering is powerful for inline editing
- Use ternary for clear either/or UI states
- Keep component state synchronized with UI state

### Supabase Storage

- Buckets must be created before upload
- Public buckets needed for viewable photos
- RLS policies control access granularly
