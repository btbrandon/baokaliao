# Map Popup UI Improvements

## Overview

Redesigned the marker popup UI for both Food to Try and Food Reviews maps to provide a cleaner, more modern, and visually appealing experience.

## Changes Made

### Food to Try Map Popups (`components/food-to-try/food-to-try-map-view.tsx`)

#### Before

- Used MUI Card/CardContent components that didn't integrate well with map popups
- Cluttered layout with large spacing
- No image preview
- Poor visual hierarchy

#### After

- **Removed Card wrapper**: Direct Box component for better integration with map popup styling
- **Image preview**: Displays item image at the top (140px height) if available
- **Compact layout**: Reduced spacing and padding for cleaner look
- **Better typography hierarchy**:
  - Cuisine flag + name with larger emoji
  - Smaller, styled Chip for cuisine type
  - Compact location with icon
  - Truncated description (2 lines max)
- **Hover effects**: "View Details" link underlines on hover
- **Responsive sizing**: maxWidth set to 320px for consistency
- **Improved spacing**: All elements properly spaced with sx prop

### Food Reviews Map Popups (`components/food-review/reviews-map.tsx`)

#### Before

- Basic Card layout with minimal styling
- Date above rating (awkward layout)
- Large spacing between elements
- No photo preview

#### After

- **Removed Card wrapper**: Direct Box component for cleaner popup
- **Photo preview**: Shows first review photo at top (140px height) if available
- **Better rating display**:
  - Rating stars with numeric value side-by-side
  - More compact and easier to scan
- **Improved metadata layout**:
  - Date and dish count on same line with bullet separator
  - Smaller, styled Chip for dish count
- **Truncated notes**: Shows up to 2 lines of notes with ellipsis
- **Consistent styling**: Matches food to try popup design
- **Better click affordance**: Clear "View Details" call-to-action

## Visual Improvements

### Typography

- Reduced font sizes for better density
- Increased font weights for important elements (title, ratings)
- Better line-height for readability
- Used consistent caption sizing (0.75rem)

### Spacing

- Reduced padding from default CardContent to custom px/pb values
- Smaller gaps between elements (0.5, 0.75 instead of 1)
- Compact chip sizing (height: 18-20px)
- Consistent margin bottom values

### Colors & Styling

- Primary color chips with white text for cuisine
- Grey chips for metadata (dish count)
- Proper text.secondary for less important info
- Border radius on images for polish

### Interactive Elements

- Hover effect on "View Details" text
- Entire popup clickable (better UX)
- Proper cursor indicators

## Technical Details

### Popup Configuration

```typescript
<Popup
  anchor="bottom"
  offset={25}
  maxWidth="320px"
  // ... other props
>
```

### Image Handling

- Conditional rendering only when images exist
- Fixed height (140px) for consistency
- objectFit: cover to prevent distortion
- Border radius only on top corners

### Text Truncation

```typescript
sx={{
  overflow: 'hidden',
  textOverflow: 'ellipsis',
  display: '-webkit-box',
  WebkitLineClamp: 2,
  WebkitBoxOrient: 'vertical',
}}
```

## Benefits

1. **Better visual hierarchy**: Users can quickly scan important info
2. **More compact**: Shows more information in less space
3. **Consistent design**: Both popups follow the same design pattern
4. **Better mobile experience**: Compact layout works better on small screens
5. **Improved readability**: Better typography and spacing choices
6. **Visual appeal**: Images make popups more engaging
7. **Clear CTAs**: Obvious "View Details" action
