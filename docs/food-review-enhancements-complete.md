# Food Review Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Date: 7 October 2025

---

## ✅ All Five Requirements Implemented

### 1. Single Expense Creation with Bill Adjustments ✅

**Previous Behavior:**

- Created separate expense for each dish
- Example: 3 dishes = 3 separate expenses in expense tracker

**New Behavior:**

- Creates **ONE expense** for the entire review
- Uses the restaurant name as description
- Applies all bill adjustments (GST, service charge, bill splitting)
- Amount reflects the adjusted total per person

**Implementation:**

#### Types Updated (`types/index.ts`)

```typescript
export interface BillAdjustments {
  apply_gst: boolean;
  apply_service_charge: boolean;
  split_bill: boolean;
  number_of_people: number;
}
```

#### Service Logic (`services/food-review/service.ts`)

```typescript
// Calculation flow:
1. Subtotal = sum of all dish prices
2. If GST: × 1.09 (9% tax)
3. If Service Charge: × 1.10 (10% charge)
4. If Split Bill: ÷ number_of_people

// Result: One expense with adjusted amount
```

#### Example:

```
Dishes:
- Chicken Rice: $5.50
- Laksa: $6.00
- Bubble Tea: $4.50
Subtotal: $16.00

With GST (9%): $16.00 × 1.09 = $17.44
With Service Charge (10%): $17.44 × 1.10 = $19.18
Split by 2 people: $19.18 ÷ 2 = $9.59 per person

Expense created:
- Description: "Restaurant Name"
- Amount: $9.59
- Category: "Food & Dining"
- Date: Visit date
- Notes: "Food review expense (split 2 ways)"
```

### 2. Edit Review Functionality ✅

**Implementation:**

#### Component Updates

- **`AddFoodReview`** now supports both add and edit modes
- Props: `reviewId?: string | null` determines mode
- Title: "Add Food Review" or "Edit Food Review"
- Button: "Create Review" or "Update Review"

#### Features:

- ✅ Load existing review data when editing
- ✅ Pre-populate all fields (place, dishes, ratings, photos)
- ✅ Preserve bill adjustments (though not stored, current UI state)
- ✅ Update via PATCH endpoint
- ✅ Edit button in review details dialog
- ✅ Edit icon in reviews list

#### Flow:

```
1. Click "Edit" icon on review card → Opens edit dialog
2. OR click "Edit Review" button in details view → Opens edit dialog
3. Form pre-populated with all existing data
4. Make changes
5. Click "Update Review" → Saves changes
6. Review list refreshes automatically
```

#### Files Modified:

- `components/food-review/add-food-review.tsx` - Added edit mode support
- `components/food-review/food-review-details.tsx` - Added Edit button
- `components/food-review/food-reviews-list.tsx` - Passes onEdit callback
- `app/food-reviews/page.tsx` - Manages edit state

---

### 3. Rating Display Fixed (2.5 Stars Shows Correctly) ✅

**Problem:** MUI Rating component rounds to nearest integer by default

**Solution:** Explicitly add `precision={0.5}` to ALL Rating components

#### Files Fixed:

1. **`add-food-review.tsx`**
   - Dish display rating: `<Rating ... precision={0.5} />`
2. **`food-review-details.tsx`**
   - Dish rating: `<Rating ... precision={0.5} />`
3. **`food-reviews-list.tsx`**
   - Dish rating in list: `<Rating ... precision={0.5} />`

#### Result:

| Input  | Before | After     |
| ------ | ------ | --------- |
| 0.5 ⭐ | 1 ⭐   | 0.5 ⭐ ✅ |
| 2.5 ⭐ | 3 ⭐   | 2.5 ⭐ ✅ |
| 4.5 ⭐ | 5 ⭐   | 4.5 ⭐ ✅ |

**Note:** The rating was always saved correctly, just displayed wrong!

### 4. Delete Button Shows Only on Hover ✅

**Implementation:**

#### CSS Styling:

```typescript
// Card hover rule
<Card sx={{
  '&:hover .delete-button': {
    opacity: 1,
  },
}}>

// Delete button
<IconButton
  className="delete-button"
  sx={{ opacity: 0, transition: 'opacity 0.2s' }}
>
  <DeleteIcon />
</IconButton>
```

#### Behavior:

- Default state: Delete button invisible (opacity: 0)
- On card hover: Delete button fades in (opacity: 1)
- Smooth transition: 0.2s fade animation
- Edit button remains always visible

#### User Experience:

- Cleaner UI when browsing reviews
- Delete button appears when needed
- Prevents accidental deletions
- Modern, polished interaction

---

### 5. Preserve Line Breaks in Notes ✅

**Problem:** Line breaks in notes were collapsed into single line

**Solution:** Add `whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap'` to Typography components

#### Files Fixed:

1. **Review notes** (`food-review-details.tsx`)

   ```tsx
   <Typography sx={{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap' }}>{review.notes}</Typography>
   ```

2. **Dish notes** (`food-review-details.tsx`)

   ```tsx
   <Typography sx={{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap' }}>{dish.notes}</Typography>
   ```

3. **Review notes in list** (`food-reviews-list.tsx`)
   ```tsx
   <Typography sx={{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap' }}>{review.notes}</Typography>
   ```

#### Example:

```
User types:
"Amazing restaurant!

The ambiance was great.
Service was excellent."

Before fix (single line):
"Amazing restaurant! The ambiance was great. Service was excellent."

After fix (preserves formatting):
"Amazing restaurant!

The ambiance was great.
Service was excellent."
```

## 📋 Technical Details

### API Changes

#### Expense Creation Logic

```typescript
// Old: Per-dish expenses
for (dish in dishes) {
  if (dish.create_expense) {
    createExpense({
      amount: dish.price,
      description: `${restaurant} - ${dish.name}`,
    });
  }
}

// New: Single review expense with adjustments
if (anyDishHasExpense && bill_adjustments) {
  const total = calculateAdjustedTotal(dishes, bill_adjustments);
  createExpense({
    amount: total,
    description: restaurant_name,
  });
}
```

### Component Architecture

#### Edit Flow

```
food-reviews/page.tsx
├── FoodReviewsList
│   └── Edit icon → handleEditReview(id)
├── FoodReviewDetails
│   └── Edit button → handleEditReview(id)
└── AddFoodReview (edit mode)
    ├── Load review data via useEffect
    ├── Pre-populate form
    └── Submit → updateReview()
```

### State Management

#### Edit State

```typescript
const [editReviewId, setEditReviewId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const isEditMode = !!reviewId;
```

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why Single Expense Per Review?

- **Simpler expense tracking**: One line item vs multiple
- **Accurate total**: Includes taxes and service charges
- **Reflects reality**: You pay one bill, not per dish
- **Split bills**: Expense shows your actual share

### Why Edit Full Review?

- **Complete flexibility**: Change any aspect
- **Fix mistakes**: Typos, wrong dates, missing dishes
- **Add details later**: Photos, notes, ratings
- **Update information**: Prices change, dishes renamed

### Why Hover for Delete?

- **Cleaner interface**: Less visual clutter
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show when needed
- **Prevent accidents**: Less likely to click by mistake
- **Modern UX**: Common pattern in modern apps

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Database Operations

- Edit mode: Additional query to load review
- Expense creation: One insert instead of N inserts
- Net result: **Faster** for multi-dish reviews

### UI Rendering

- Hover animations: Smooth via CSS transitions
- Line breaks: No performance impact
- Rating precision: Same rendering cost
